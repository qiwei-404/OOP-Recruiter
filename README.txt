1. About README: README is a text file that contains the guideline to use the program. Failure to read and follow the guideline may result in unexpected errors.

2. The user interface: This program GUI. There will be prompts and instructions on the window. The instructions are very clear easy to follow. Please make sure you follow those instructions. Otherwise, you may not be able to get the desired outcome.

3. UML: The Phase2UML.pdf shows the design notes and class structures of our project.

4. Data storage: The complete data is only stored while the program is running. When the program stops, only username, password, and company name are stored in the directory called "/file/". If you exit the program, you cannot retrieve the full data when you log in again. You do not have to worry about creating that directory. This program creates that for you.

5. User input of Strings: When the GUI requires a String input from users, make sure you follow the instructions on the GUI so that the program parses your input correctly. Some inputs, for example, required documents and interview types in job posting creation window, are case insensitive. Other inputs like username and password are case sensitive.

5. Required functionality: We have implemented most of the required functionality in the project specification.

6. Extra functionality: This program allows professional references and notifies applicants their latest submission status when they log in.

7. Sign up: You can sign up with any username and password combination you want. However, you cannot choose a username identical to a username of another user before you, even if they exited the program already. The sign up function checks all the credentials under "/file/".

8. Log in: To log back into the system, you must provide a matching username and password from the time you signed up, even if you exited the program after signing up. The log in function also checks all the credentials under "/file/".

9. Log out: You can only log out on specific windows with the "log out" button.

10. Exit: You can press the "x" button on the window to exit the program at any time.

11. Future development: There maybe unused classes and methods and comments. They are intended for future development.

12. Run Main.java at startup
